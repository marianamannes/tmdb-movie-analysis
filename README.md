# TMDB Movie Analysis

The dataset [Kaggle: TMDb Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/juzershakir/tmdb-movies-dataset) contains information about 10k movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. In this project, my goal was to answer some case study questions about the dataset through the Python language:

- **Question #1**: which actors have the most appearances in films? 
- **Question #2**: which genre was most popular through the years? 
- **Question #3**: which are the top movies based on popularity? 
- **Question #4**: which director produces the highest revenue movies? 
- **Question #5**: what kind of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
